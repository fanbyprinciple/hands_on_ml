## Tensorflow

Tensorflow makes computation easier by making a graph of computation and then running it using efficient C++ code.

More importantly youcan devide the graph for parallel GPU operation

Also supports distributed computing,it means it can be used over multiple servers 

Developed by google brain team that also created google photos and search

Most features are there in other libraries , it was open sourced.

With tensorflow we can also run quantum physics simulations if we wanted

tf.learn(not TFLearn) compatible with scikit-learn

tf-slim for simplifying building, training and evaluating neural network

provides advanced optimisation nodes to search for parameters to minimise a cost function. Tensorflow autmatically takes care of computing gradients of function we define

tensorboard to visualise computation graph, view learning graph.
