Supervised  - labels
Unsupervised - no labels ex.clustering , visualisation and dimensionality reduction, association rule learning
Semisupervised - onelabel per image rest clustering like google photos
Reinforcement - policy based state choosing,alpha go

Batch learning - The system is incapable of learning incremently, all data must be supplied at once. Also called offline learning

Online Learning - The system learns incremently after feeding it data continuosly or in batches, new data on the fly. The learning rate becomes important in these systems. 

Instance based Learning - it learns examples by heart then using a similarity measure generlaiszes to new cases.
Model based Learning - Build a model and then make predictions
